 * Check if edit distance between two strings is one
 * An edit between two strings is one of the following changes.

Add a character
Delete a character
Change a character

Given two string s1 and s2, find if s1 can be converted to s2 with exactly one edit. 
Expected time complexity is O(m+n) where m and n are lengths of two strings.
